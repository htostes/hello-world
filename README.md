# hello-world
First repository

My name is Henrique, at the moment I'm a Biomedical Informatics student at Universidade de SÃ£o Paulo. In my free time I like to either learn programming or do some personal project, also related to programming. I decided to focus on python since it has libraries that support bioinformatics and data science, which are my favorite areas.

In this repository I decided to store all my python scripts that I created during my learning course. These are the simple ones, for my other personal projects and real-problem-solve scripts I'm going to create other repositories.

Enjoy.
